ok so with this script you can plow a lot of .ir (.ir is the Internet country code top-level domain for Iran) domains and see if they are avaliable or not.
it's really handy and easy to use, just make a csv file and write the domains into it for example:
```
digikala.ir
&nbsp;
amazon.ir
former.ir
apple.ir
....
```
NOTE: It's only working with .ir domains for now. happy me with your pull requests ðŸ˜†
